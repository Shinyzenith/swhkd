swhkd is a display protocol-independent hotkey daemon made in Rust.
.PP
swhkd uses an easy-to-use configuration system inspired by sxhkd so you
can easily add or remove hotkeys.
.PP
It is also a drop-in replacement for sxhkd, meaning, your sxhkd config
file is also compatible with swhkd.
.PP
Because swhkd can be used anywhere, the same swhkd config can be used
across Xorg or Wayland desktops, and you can even use swhkd in a tty.
